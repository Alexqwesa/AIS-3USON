- BUG: make dep_has_worker work correctly with duplicate workers !!!!!
- BUG: make uniq user field in worker table


 - Check one session per user!
 - filter services list for each client
 - _submitAll: mark failed as "failed to save" cell
 - _submitAll: popup previous value
 - repaint view after update metadata
 - filter model run in background
 - pause filters before fetch_all
 - model: store list of connected filters
 - filter based on id, not DisplayValue
 - _submitAll in separate thread!
 - shadow model for each model? (in case of select update)
 - priority of model select, in names?
 - F3 - new row with total of current tableview
 - maybe use list instead combobox for contracts of ufio
 - DepQComboBox on_showEvent show first filtered value
 - on set_where - create new model in async, store 10 last models, mark widgets update_in_progress
 - on data change select one day, then switch to month
 - use emitCurrentIndexChanged_do
 - on select dirty model ask save/discard
 - Contracts in client tab should be list, not combobox
 - use named list or list_record
 - services: dont use new every year, add meta service table
 - debug - add clean lru_cache
 - tableYear - show filled in different color if some of the services filled another department
 - tableYear - show filled in different color if some of the services filled another year
 - highlight headers of tableView on selection  (maybe mark dirty rows)
 - maybe load big model, and use small proxy models to connect to table?
 - local cache DB?
 - mark report outdated if added new entry in journal
 - message = debug.message + if windowed QMessage, else in console set flag
 - reselect from DB - treat as special [cellEdits] object  - add it to journal with new id
 - connect journal_change to cache_clear() of special journal_readers() in models
 - model: call journal less?
 - journal in separate thread
 -[] update row - try whole row, then each column separatly
 -[] insert row - try whole row, on error ...
 -[] postEvent to apply filters
 -[] _serv_activ is too slow
 -[] SQL short_fio delete and predvmin
 -[] list of printed invoices

 -[x]  - SD.unsaved_view and etc should be arrays
 -[x]  - _submitAll - support insert
 -[x] ? - myQComboBox don't change index if data not changed on model update/select
 -[x]  - use cached journal readers in models

BUGS
-[x] table - not updated by default
-[ ] update backgraund of view after insert
-[ ] editTextChanged is fired as soon as select get new data, but we use variable to control selection state,
 this lead to inconsistence... (dirty fix in get_data_from_model_name)



DONE - DataMapper not always switched - after model changed (sometimes stay empty  )
DONE - QComboBox sometimes no new row (вкладка на месяц после смены отделения)


Qt Designer: highlight slots/signals
